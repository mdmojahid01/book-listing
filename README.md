# Book Listing and Contact Form

Dear visitor of this repo,
I made this project to show my work during my Internship Interview. The Interviewer gave me a task to be done by using React JS.

So, I learned React JS First time during this interview task and I implemented react-bootstrap carousel, Navbar, and form validation and also state management using react-redux and redux-toolkit in this task.

## Note

In this project, Contact Form Submission data is Stored in Local JSON API, For working form this API server needs to start but This web app is hosted on netlify so, form submission does not work on the live link. and I didn't fix this Api server issue in the live server because, after selected in an internship, I left this project as it is.ðŸ˜€ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
